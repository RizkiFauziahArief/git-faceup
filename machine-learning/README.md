# Machine Learning
## Dataset
The dataset is organized into the following directories:
- `Blackhead`: Contains acne images labeled with Blackhead.
- `Nodules`: Contains acne images labeled with Nodules.
- `Papule`: Contains acne images labeled with Papule.
- `Pustules`: Contains acne images labeled with Pustules.
- `Whitehead`: Contains acne images labeled with Whitehead.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run the code in this repository:
- Python
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install the required packages by running the following command:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Model Building and Result

The model building step and results of the acne type classification can be found in the model_building.ipynb file. This includes data preprocessing, CNN model, evaluation metrics, confusion matrix, and model's predictions. You can replicate the steps.
